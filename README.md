# Oscilloscope-Clock

Setup Instructions:
- Make sure your 'scope is set to X-Y mode
- Connect X to the RIGHT audio channel
- Connect Y to the LEFT audio
- Adjust your 'scope to fit the display as necessary
  
Now your oscilloscope is a digital clock!


WARNING: If you are using integrated audio, there may
be interference, and the lines will not be as precise.
I use a Sound Blaster Audigy FX (they run for about $25).
